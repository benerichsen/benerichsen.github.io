            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>I’ve worked as a commercial real estate broker in the Miami area for the past 15 years. After the mortgage industry collapse in 2007, I began to look for alternative sources of income.</li>
                <li>I spoke to a friend in California who was growing medical marijuana for dispensaries and he offered to teach me the business.</li>
                <li>Over the next 4 years I grew marijuana in rental houses, industrial warehouses, and outdoors on land I purchased in Northern California.</li>
                <li>During that time I encountered just about every major problem a grower can face.  I had trouble finding suitable spaces, issues with contractors, security issues--you name it.  That's where I first had the idea for Crown Canna.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Obstacles -->
        <section>
            <section>
                <h1>Obstacles</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Colorado, an address for a grow space is required prior to applying for a cultivation license.   The license isn’t issued until the completed grow space has been inspected by both the city and county.</li>
                    <li>A grower must therefore invest a large amount of time and money without any guarantee that his license application will be approved.</li>
                    <li>One of the most challenging obstacles any grower will face is finding a suitable property that’s zoned for cultivation and has the infrastructure to accommodate a commercial grow.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Obstacles</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recently, strict zoning ordinances and moratoriums have made it very difficult to find cultivation locations throughout Colorado. Often growers find themselves competing for the same properties.</li>
                    <li>Growers who choose to lease instead of purchase property face the difficult task of finding a landlord who’s willing to accommodate them. Landlords who are willing lease to growers typically charge a large premium for space.</li>
                    <li>Growroom build-outs can be very pricey and time consuming.  Properties will often require extensive power upgrades which can cost as much as $200k. Equipment and construction will cost the grower an additional $120k or more.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Obstacles</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are very few professional contractors that have experience designing and building grow rooms to code. Even the most capable contractor will face the expensive and time-consuming process of trial and error.  The ones that do have experience are in high demand and extremely expensive.</li>
                    <li>When you hire a contractor he usually hires subcontractors. The more people that know about a grow facility, the greater the threat of robbery. </li>
                    <li>In most grow facilities sufficient security is often lacking, either through oversight or because of the expense. </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crown Canna has developed a concept for cutting edge turnkey grow spaces for qualified marijuana growers, and we have the team in place to execute it.</li>
                    <li>By choosing Crown Canna, growers can sign a lease and start cultivation within days not months.</li>
                    <li>Our turnkey spaces are professionally designed and built by Crown Canna’s industry experts.</li>
                    <li>The units will fulfill all the requirements set forth in the CO licensing process and will be guaranteed to pass inspection.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>By skipping the build-out process, tenants can save 3-6 months of time and rent while significantly increasing first year profits.</li>
                    <li>Crown will have 24-hour security with an armed guard and digital HD cameras. </li>
                    <li>By leasing a Crown unit, our tenants can avoid the many risks associated with pursuing their own build-out.</li>

            <h1>Market Validation</h1>
            <ul>
                <p>We chose to launch our operations in Denver after we spent time there gauging the demand for grow space firsthand.  We met with many dispensary owners and growers.  Almost all of them expressed enthusiasm for the Crown concept as well as their frustration in trying to locate adequate cultivation space.   Sales of marijuana in Colorado reached $700m last year despite frequent shortages.  The demand for recreational and medicinal marijuana is exploding in Colorado and there is a clear need for additional grow space to meet it.</p>

            <h1>Model/Product & Services</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>We plan to buy a 25,000 sf industrial property in the Denver area for $80 sq/ft.  The structure will then be renovated and subdivided into approximately 10-12 private grow spaces. </li>
                <li>We anticipate a total purchase price of the unimproved building to be about $2m and the renovation is expected to cost about another $1m.</li>
                <li>Each unit is expected to generate revenue of $170k year ($85 sq/ft/yr) with the total annual property revenue anticipated to be about $2m.  Annual operating expenses are estimated to be about $670k.  We project annual net rental income to be about $1.4m.  Crown will also realize additional revenue through consulting services as well as through the sale of packaging solutions and materials.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>You've met my partner, Jonas, and I already. I'd like to mention the other members of our team.  Bryan Maffei is a licensed California contractor and has over 15 years of experience designing and building state-of-the-art grow spaces.  He will oversee all aspects of grow-space design and build-out.</li>

Mr. Stookey founded Huffman Builders West and developed 1 million square feet of office/commercial real estate in NV and CA.

        <!-- Competition -->
        <section>
            <h1>Competition</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no one currently offering turn-key grow space in the Denver area.  Several companies do claim to offer cultivation space but our calls to each company revealed that none of them are actually operational.  Most appear to be facade companies looking to capitalize on the high-profile growth of the marijuana industry through their penny stock listings.</li>
                <li>The only competition Crown will face in the near-term future is the alternate option of growers buying and building out their own grow space.  The cost and logistical problems associated with that option prevents it from being considered a true competitive threat to our business model.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>$3m will be used to purchase the unimproved industrial space and to renovate it.</li>
                <li>$500k will be held to cover operating expenses until tenants are in place.  </li>
