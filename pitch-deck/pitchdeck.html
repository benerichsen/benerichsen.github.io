        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <ul class="fa-ul">
                <li>Crown Canna's founder has worked as a commercial real estate broker in the Miami area for the past 15 years. After the mortgage industry collapse in 2007, he began to look for alternative sources of income.</li>
                <li>A friend in California who was growing medical marijuana for dispensaries offered to teach him about the business.</li>
                <li>Over the next 4 years he grew marijuana in rental houses, industrial warehouses, and outdoors on land he had purchased in Northern California.</li>
                <li>During that time, he encountered just about every major problem a grower can face: trouble finding suitable spaces, issues with contractors, security issues--you name it.  That's when the idea for Crown Canna was born.</li>

        <!-- Obstacles -->
       <section>
                <h1>Obstacles</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Colorado, an address for a grow space is required prior to applying for a cultivation license.   The license isn’t issued until the completed grow space has been inspected by both the city and county.</li>
                    <li>One of the most challenging obstacles any grower will face is finding a suitable property that’s zoned for cultivation and has the infrastructure to accommodate a commercial grow.</li>
                    <li>When leasing, a grower must find one of the few landlords willing to lease for the purpose of cultivation.</li>
                    <li>Growing build-outs can be very pricey and time consuming with costs regularly reaching $200,000+.</li>
                    <li>Few professional contractors have experience designing and building grow rooms to code and those that do are costly and in high demand.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>
        
        <!-- Solution -->
        <section>
                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crown Canna has developed a concept for cutting edge turnkey grow spaces designed and built by Crown Canna’s industry experts.</li>
                    <li>By choosing Crown Canna, growers can sign a lease and start cultivation within days not months.</li>
                    <li>Units will fulfill all the requirements set forth in the CO licensing process and will be guaranteed to pass inspection.</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- Market Validation -->
        <section>
            <h1>Market Validation</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>We chose Denver to launch operations after researching demand for grow space firsthand.</li>
                <li>Many dispensary owners and growers we met with expressed enthusiasm for the Crown concept and spoke of the extreme shortage of grow space.</li>
                <li>Sales of marijuana in Colorado exceeded $900m in 2015, from $700m in 2014.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

                <li>"You won't find another industry growing at that kind of clip"--ArcView Group CEO.</li>
                <li>Demand for grow space will continue to explode as more states follow the examples set by Colorado and Washington.</li>
                <li>Crown's business plan is scalable and can be leveraged to take advantage of new U.S. markets as laws continue to change.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Competition</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>No one currently offers turn-key grow space in the Denver area.  </li>
                <li>Several companies claim to offer cultivation space but our calls to each company revealed that none are operational. </li>
                <li>The only competition Crown will face in the near-term future is the alternate option of growers buying and building out their own grow space.  Cost and logistical concerns prevent it from being considered a true competitive threat to our business model.</li>
